Valedictorian Melinda plans to sneakily sell alcohol to her classmates at the party to pay her tuition, and every-girl Deanna gets ready to finally admit her feelings for her best friend Fig, who only has eyes for Roni. As the night goes on, the kids' quests overlap, intertwine, and -in some cases- implode. What would you do with your last night in high school?</p>",
